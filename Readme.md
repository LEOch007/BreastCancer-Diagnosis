### Breast Cancer Diagnosis

---

A typical classification task to determine whether the cancer is benign or malignant.

The dataset is from UCI-ML: WDBC (Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer).

There are some features in dataset, i.e.:

- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry 
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
